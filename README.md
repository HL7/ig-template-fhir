# Draft SEIR Implementation Guide (SEIR IG)



## Disclaimer:

This repository is currently in the development phase. The project is not yet ready for public consumption. It is still being actively worked on, and we are addressing various features and functionality. This current version is being developed by SSCP-CSIRO and UPM SILab team with the supervision of the Department of Health - Knowledge Management and Information Technology Service (DOH-KMITS).


## Contributions:

At this stage, contributions to this repository are only permitted for authorized and specific stakeholders. Access to contribute will be granted based on the project's needs and stakeholder involvement. Once the project reaches a stable state and is deemed ready for public consultation, the repository will be opened up for public contributions. Thank you for your understanding and patience!

## Future Plans:

Upon finalization of the the Official Implementation Guide, the content of this repository will be transitioned to a more appropriate and permanent location.
