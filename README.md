# Draft Philippine Core Implementation Guide (PH CORE IG)



## Disclaimer:

This repository is currently in the development phase. The project is not yet ready for public consumption. It is still being actively worked on, and we are addressing various features and functionality. This current version is being developed by SSCP-CSIRO and UPM SILab team with the supervision of the Department of Health - Knowledge Management and Information Technology Service (DOH-KMITS).

## About the PH Core IG:

PH Core defines the Data model and RESTful API interactions that set minimum expectations for a system to record, update, search, and retrieve core digital health and administrative information. Applications that conform to PH Core can access the following information about the patient:

- Basic patient details
- Problems / Conditions
- Medication orders, dispense, administration and usage
- Immunization history
- Allergies and intolerances
- Diagnostic orders, report, and results
- Vital signs, and other clinical observations
- Clinical notes & other patient documents

PH Core provides basis for profiles that define the FHIR resources to be supported, and the elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets that SHALL be present are identified, and how they are used is defined. It also documents the minimum FHIR RESTful interactions for each resource type to access patient data. PH Core promotes interoperability and adoption through common implementation and SHOULD be built on top of for standards development for specific use cases. 

## Contributions:

At this stage, contributions to this repository are only permitted for authorized and specific stakeholders. Access to contribute will be granted based on the project's needs and stakeholder involvement. Once the project reaches a stable state and is deemed ready for public consultation, the repository will be opened up for public contributions. Thank you for your understanding and patience!

## Future Plans:

Upon finalization of the official Philippine Core (PH Core) Implementation Guide, the content of this repository will be transitioned to a more appropriate and permanent location.
